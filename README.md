# Book-Price-Management-with-Hidden-Accountant
Ensures book prices are automatically recorded by an Accountant while keeping the class hidden from users of Book. The setPrice method directly updates the accountantâ€™s records using this explicitly. A test program displays book details and the total recorded prices, demonstrating encapsulation and controlled data access.
